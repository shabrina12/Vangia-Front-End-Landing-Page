## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - JS library to add icons

### What I learned

I learned a simple way to add slider function in testimonial section using swiper js library

Code snippets, see below:
```js
<Swiper className='swiper'
            breakpoints={{
                // width >= 300
                300: {
                    slidesPerView: 1,
                    spaceBetween: 70
                },
                // width >= 600
                600: {
                    slidesPerView: 1,
                    spaceBetween: 100
                },
                // width >= 1000
                1000: {
                    slidesPerView: 2,
                    spaceBetween: 130
                }
            }}
            modules={[Navigation, Pagination, A11y]}
            spaceBetween={120}
            slidesPerView={2}
            navigation
            pagination={{ clickable: true }}
            onSlideChange={() => console.log('slide change')}
            onSwiper={(swiper) => console.log(swiper)}
        >
```
